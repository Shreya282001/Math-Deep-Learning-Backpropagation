# How Machines Learn from Mistakes: A Deep Dive into Backpropagation

## Abstract or Overview
This blog-style article provides an in-depth yet beginner-friendly exploration of the backpropagation algorithm â€” the core learning mechanism behind neural networks. It simplifies complex mathematical routines using pseudocode, visuals, real-world examples, and worked-out numerical demonstrations.

## Data Description
The article is self-contained and does not rely on an external dataset. However, it references the MNIST dataset as a use case to illustrate the practical application of backpropagation in image recognition.
